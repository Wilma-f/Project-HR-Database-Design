# Project: Designing an HR Database from the Udacity Data Architect Nanodegree program.

# Project Overview
For this project, I designed, built, and populated a relational database for the HR Department of the fictional Tech ABC Corp. Based on the HR managerâ€™s requirements,I created entity relationship diagrams (ERDs), normalized the data to 3NF, and implemented the final database schema using PostgreSQL.

# Business Scenario
Tech ABC Corp experienced explosive growth after launching a successful AI-powered video game console. The company rapidly expanded from a 10-person team to over 200 employees across five locations in less than a year.
The HR department was managing employee data in a spreadsheet, which became inefficient and error-prone with the scale. As the newly hired data architect, I was tasked with designing a scalable and efficient database system to manage employee records and support future growth.

# Dataset
The HR dataset you will be working with is an Excel workbook consisting of 206 records, with eleven columns. The data is in human-readable format and has not been normalized at all. The data lists the names of employees at Tech ABC Corp, as well as information such as job title, department, manager's name, hire date, start date, end date, work location, and salary.

# Implementation Steps.
-Analyzed business requirements.
-Reviewed and cleaned the raw dataset from Excel file.
-Normalized the data to Third Normal Form (3NF).
-Identified key entities: Employees, Departments, Jobs, Locations, Managers.
-Created three Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) using Lucidchart:
  Conceptual ERD,
  Logical ERD,
  Physical ERD,
-Used PostgreSQL and pgAdmin to:
 Define the database schema and create tables with DDL scripts.
 Populate tables with data using DML statements.
 Perform CRUD operations to test and validate the schema.
