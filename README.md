# Project-HR-Database-Design
# Project 1: Designing an HR Database from the Udacity Data Architect Nanodegree program.

# Project Overview
For this project, I designed, built, and populated a relational database for the HR Department of the fictional Tech ABC Corp. Based on the HR managerâ€™s requirements, I created ER diagrams and implemented the database schema.

# Business Scenario
Tech ABC Corp saw explosive growth with a sudden appearance onto the gaming scene with its new AI-powered video game console. As a result, they have gone from a small 10 person operation to 200 employees and 5 locations in under a year. HR is having trouble keeping up with the growth since they are still maintaining employee information in a spreadsheet. While that worked for ten employees, it has become increasingly cumbersome to manage as the company expands.
As such, the HR department has tasked you, as the new data architect, to design and build a database capable of managing their employee information.

# Dataset
The HR dataset you will be working with is an Excel workbook consisting of 206 records, with eleven columns. The data is in human-readable format and has not been normalized at all. The data lists the names of employees at Tech ABC Corp, as well as information such as job title, department, manager's name, hire date, start date, end date, work location, and salary.
